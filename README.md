# Background

The Wordle concept puzzle game was earlier delivered by NYTimes and trended vastly across various Social Media globally. The basic operation is for a user to guess a 5-letter word within 6 guesses/tries. Over thousands of people played and shared their scores online via the graphical score share provided to `show off` their vocabulary aptitude.

WordChain brings this simple implementation to the BlockChain, providing users worldwide the ability to stake WordChainTokens, for a particular tournament duration, while playing rounds of Wordle against other users around the world. Users can create and play private, for close friends in a group, and public tournaments with a minimum required stake, which other users can join after staking this minimum required.

When the tournament reaches the deadline, the staked tokens are distributed between the top three contestants for the tournament.


# Note

WordChain is soon going live on the Ethereum Mainnet.
